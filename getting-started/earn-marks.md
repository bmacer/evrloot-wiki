# How to Get Marks?

**Nothing's more easy! Just play the game.**

You can get Marks in many ways:

## By Completing the Questboard

The Questboard is the heart of our Campaign, offering an engaging, challenging, and rewarding way to dive into the game.

It features two key paths:
- **The Tutorial Board**: For onboarding.
- **The Achievement Board**: For tackling milestones.

### Tutorial Board

The Tutorial Board is designed to guide new players step-by-step through the game's fundamentals, from how to play, to recruiting Warborn, battling, completing missions, and embarking on expeditions.

Each node on the board represents a core mechanic, such as recruiting Warborn, battling, completing missions, and embarking on expeditions.

**Example Node:**
- **Fresh Blood Arrival**
  - Stranded in Traka, you will need help to achieve your goals.
  - **Rewards:**
    - 23 Eruloott Marks
    - 1 Suspicious Weapon Pack
    - 1 Mystery Reward

Players earn Marks, Gilts, and Weapons & Armor Packs by completing these nodes.

Once finished, players will have gained the knowledge and resources needed to tackle the Achievement Board—where the true challenges begin!

### Achievement Board

The Achievement Board shatters linearity, offering players a variety of milestones to pursue at their own pace.

Organized into task clusters, the nodes can be completed independently. These clusters cover a wide range of objectives for both Warborn and Citizens, such as recruiting more Warborn, gathering resources, defeating enemies, conquering bosses, and much more.

**Example Cluster:**
- **Gilts**
  - **Gilt Gatherer**
    - Collect 1,000 Gilts.
    - **Rewards:** 20 Eruloott Marks
  - **Gilt Hoarder**
    - Collect 5,000 Gilts.
    - **Rewards:** 40 Eruloott Marks
  - **Gilt Tycoon**
    - Collect 10,000 Gilts.
    - **Rewards:** 60 Eruloott Marks

Each cluster focuses on a specific task and progresses in difficulty—higher ranks are more challenging but offer greater rewards.

Every completed node grants Marks, Gilts, and Weapons & Armor Packs, making every effort worthwhile!

Expeditions are a fantastic way to earn Marks. In the Sand Tower, defeating enemies can yield Marks, Gilts, and gear.
