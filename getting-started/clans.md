# Clans: A Community Feature

As part of our Release Campaign, you can join a clan created by selected curators to unlock additional rewards and collaborate with fellow looters. The more active your clan, the greater the rewards!

Depending on your clan's overall activity, all members can receive a bonus of up to 25% on the Marks you earn. Stay engaged and active in your clan to maximize your rewards and enjoy the benefits of teamwork!

- **See your clan, bonus, and referral code** from the quick access on the Quest Board.
- All clan features are on the left of the Quest Board.

## Invite Others and Reap Rewards!

Joining a clan comes with an exclusive referral link, giving you the chance to invite others to your clan, boost the clan's bonus, and earn big rewards!

- For every person who completes the tutorial board using your link, you'll receive a whopping 100x Marks as a reward.
- Your invitees will automatically join your clan and immediately start benefiting from the bonusâ€”so start building your team and watch the rewards roll in!

## Referral Link

You can invite people to your clan with your referral link.

- This will provide you and your clan a one-time Evrloot Marks reward if they finish the tutorial.
  - **Per referral used:** +100
- Find more information on the Wiki.

## How to Join or Leave a Clan

Nothing's easier! Either use the referral code of someone or browse the list of available clans.

- Click on a specific clan to see more info about it and access the complete list of members. If it's the right clan for you, click on "Join Clan" to become a member.
  - **Join Clan**
- To leave a clan, find your clan on top of the list and open up the detail view of the clan, where you can click on "Leave Clan".
  - **Leave Clan**

You can leave or join a clan at any given moment without restrictions (unless you have been kicked out of a clan)

### Stay Active!

Each player has a timer on its activity, ranging from Active, to Warning to Inactive.

| Member           | Points  | Status  |
|------------------|---------|---------|
| deckardonchain   | 126,660 | Active  |
| Kingluuu         | 109,650 | Warning |
| MeForge          | 98,000  | Inactive|

- To stay active, you only need to send a Warborn or Soul to the Sand Tower on an expedition.
- If a player is inactive (Mabile on the Quest Board), then his clan leader can decide to kick this person out of the clan to maximize the involved bonuses. Once a player is kicked, a cooldown of 72 hours will prevent him from joining another clan.
  - **71h 59m Join Cooldown**
