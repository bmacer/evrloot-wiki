## Tips

We recommend starting with 🏃 **Missions** and stocking up on 💧 **Fresh Water**, a key resource needed for most other missions.

As you progress naturally, you'll gather 🌴 **Palmwood** from Woodlogging Missions and 🌿 **Herbs** from Herbalism Missions.

This will lead you to ⚒️ **Crafting & Professions**, where you can craft gear, brew potions, and trade with others at the 🐪 **Marketplace**.

Once ready, tackle 🌍 **Expeditions** to complete the loop and begin anew!
