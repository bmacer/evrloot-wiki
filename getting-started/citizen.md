# What is a Citizen?

Citizens are the new Evrloot Exclusive Souls Collection.  
Citizenship is granted to both Settlers (first Collection) and Citizens (New Collection).  
Originally warborn, they have earned freedom and pursued their destiny in Telcarna and beyond.

## From Warborn to Citizen (Upgrade)

You can upgrade your free-to-play Warborn into a Citizen NFTs in two ways:

- Via purchase with our flat on-ramp (Stripe) or with GLMR tokens (Moonbeam)
- By looting a Forged Trakan Citizenship (low % drop) on Mission Contracts Rewards for Warborn

### What does Upgrading a Warborn Mean?

**Exclusive New Classes**  
Upgrading will randomly transform your Warborn into one of our two new classes: The Behemoth or The Sand-Shaper.  
Each class is assigned a unique appearance, a random gender, and thousands of possible combinations for hair, skin tone, facial features, scars, and tattoos, ensuring a truly distinctive transformation every time.

**Warborn Items Upgraded Too**  
All gear already equipped when upgrading a warborn will be matched 1:1 to an equivalent Slot & Rarity gear for your new citizen Soul. These are also NFTs.  
Examples:

- You had an Epic Weapon equipped on your Warborn → You will get an Epic Behemoth Hammer or an Epic Sand-Shaper Staff after upgrading your warborn, depending on which class you will get.
- You had a Rare Chest equipped on your Warborn → You will get a Rare Behemoth or Sand-Shaper Chest.

**Enjoy Full Game Access**  
Citizens gain full access to Trakan, unlocking all game features including:

- Missions (To gather Resources and Loot)
- Marketplace (To Trade, Sell or Buy your NFTs)
- Crafting & Professions
- And SO MUCH MORE.

## True Ownership

In contrast to Warborn, Citizens belong to our latest NFT Collection and are Advanced NFTs 2.0, minted on the Moonbeam blockchain using RWRK standard technology.  
Everything your Citizen acquires—whether gathered, looted, or crafted—becomes a tradeable NFT, fully transferable and available for purchase, sale, or exchange with other players.
