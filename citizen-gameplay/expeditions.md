# Expositions

Expeditions are the heart of Exitoot's active gameplay, where you can send a "g. Citizen on thrilling dungeon valves.
Accessible through the map, marked by a red torch icon. Expeditions challenge you to navigate to the Local Boss-or even a Global Boss-and defeat it without meeting your demise.

## Preparation

### Energy Points
- A Citizen has a maximum of 4 Energy Points, each allowing them to embark on an Expedition. Without Energy Points, your Citizen cannot participate in an Expedition.
- Energy Points regenerate at a rate of 1 per day.

### Potions & Tinctures
Potions and Tinctures are powerful tools to support your Citizen during Expeditions:

- **Potions** can be used at any point outside combat to heal HP, provide combat bonuses (like damage and armor), and offer other advantages for the next battle.
- **Tinctures** provide long-lasting bonuses throughout the Expedition and are active from the start.

You can carry up to 3 Potions and 3 Tinctures per run, with Tinctures automatically consumed when entering the Expedition.

### Risky - but worth it!
Expeditions introduce exclusive Resources and Recipes into the game's economy that can't be found elsewhere.
Enemies drop these valuable items after combat, but here's the catch: your loot is not safe unless you successfully escape the Expedition.

#### When you collect new loot after combat, it enters a state of **Unsafe Loot**. This means if you die, whether in combat or while exploring the Expedition, you will lose all your Unsafe Loot.

To secure your loot, you have 2 options:
- **Find Gnellen**: Gnellen is an eccentric companion on your Expedition journey. A master at locating dungeon exits, he'll guide you to safety. You'll find Gnellen in various rooms of the Expedition-track him down to escape, secure your Unsafe Loot, and bring it home!
- **Beat the Expedition's Boss**: Each expedition has a boss, located at the deepest part of the expedition. Find the boss and defeat him to secure your Unsafe Loot.

## Layout, Enemies, Level-Up

Expeditions are divided into areas, each taking you deeper into the dungeon where monsters grow stronger and more varied.

- Each enemy drops different resources and recipes, so hunt them down to collect valuable loot!

After each combat, your Citizen gains experience and can level up.
- Each level grants Stat Points that you can allocate to enhance their abilities in battle.
- With better gear, this is the ultimate way to help your Citizen survive longer and venture deeper into the dungeon, securing even more loot than before!

## Streaks & Difficulty Levels

Defeating the final boss unlocks "Streak Mode," where the difficulty ramps up, adding new challenges and better rewards.
There are 3 levels:
- **Whisper**: Everyone starts here.
- **Terror**: Unlocked after defeating the final boss twice in a row.
- **Abyss**: Unlocked with 2 more consecutive wins.

If you die during a streak, your progress resets to Whisper, so be sure to equip your Citizen with plenty of potions and tinctures to boost their chances.
