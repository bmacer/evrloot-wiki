# The Marketplace: Heart of Evrloot's Economy

The Marketplace is your go-to hub for buying, selling, or trading any Evrloot NFT with fellow players. From Citizens and Resources to Gear and Recipes—if you've locked it in Evrloot, you can list it on the Marketplace!

- **NFTs listed on the Marketplace are securely stated in our contracts and cannot be used while listed**. To use them, simply unlist the NFTs.

## Browse Hundreds of Trades

Anyone with a Citizen can list trades to sell or trade their Evrloot NFTs. When reviewing a trade, players have two options:

1. **Bid on the trade with items of their own.**
   - A bid can consist of items, \$GLMR, or a mix of both. Ensure your offer is fair to increase the chances of it being accepted.
   - If the seller accepts your trade, the items will be exchanged automatically—no further action required!
   - *1 hour ago: Your bid got accepted. [View]*

2. **Directly buy the trade at the seller's set price.**
   - Sellers can set a \$GLMR price for direct buyouts. We plan to support additional cryptocurrencies in the future for greater convenience.
   - If a Trade Card shows a price in the bottom-right corner, it offers a buyout option.
   - *3,200 Buyout*
   - Once finalized, the seller receives their \$GLMR, and the buyer gets their new NFTs.
