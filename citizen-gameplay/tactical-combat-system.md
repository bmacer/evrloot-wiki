## Party System

### Targeting System

When affecting with a student:
- No characters typically target the first role of the enemy party.
- Passive princes and abstract form exceptions are crucial to knocking out threats in the enemy's back row.

**Targeting:**
- Unless stated otherwise, Characters' normal attacks target the enemy front row character.
- When front row dies, the next in line becomes the front row.

# Schools & Abilities

There are three schools common for all classes: Each of them defines a sub-class pipeline of this class.

## Schools

- **The Discipline tree of the Ranger**, as opposed to the more Burst-damage-heavy Appression tree, focuses on preventing enemy attacks by increasing mass chance.
- **The Utility Alchemist** is best equipped to increase the party's effectiveness with a range of Polion Buffs. With a full Aggression Playstyle, he converts to an Area Damage Menace.

### The Character's School Influences:

1. **The Passive** - the Character has access to.
2. **Does not restrict access** to active Abilities of other schools to stay flexible.
3. **Slightly buffs abilities** of the same school.

#### Let's go through them one-by-one:

Each character is born with one of three class Passives - These cannot be changed and stay the same throughout the character's career.
