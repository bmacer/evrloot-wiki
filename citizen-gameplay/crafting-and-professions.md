# Crafting & Professions

## Crafting
Crafting is simple: gather resources through Missions, and if you have the required reagents, you can create anything from gear to potions to meals. As with all gathered resources, crafted items can be traded or sold on the Marketplace.

## Professions
Crafting Professions are the key to enhancing your Citizen's overall performance, both in Expeditions and gathering missions. While several professions are already available, more are planned for release in the near future.

### Level-Up and Recipes
Each Crafting Profession progresses from Beginner to Master, with each level unlocking new default recipes and crafts that your Citizen can create and use freely.

- **Exclusive recipes** can also be discovered during Expeditions. These rare finds are highly valuable due to their rarity and the challenging resources they require, often obtained from monsters encountered in Expeditions.
- **Rare recipes and materials** can also be bought or traded on the Marketplace.
