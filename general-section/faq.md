Account Restrictions
Q: Are there any restrictions on which countries or regions can create accounts and play this game?
A: There are no restrictions on who can play Evrloot, we are decentralized by nature.

Do I need a token to play?
Q: Will I need any special token to play the game, what's the catch?
A: No. You only need to pay for gas, and most of the time we cover that when you claim. Only your player character (game token) is needed, other Resources (RSS) offer additional gameplay options but are not required to get in the action!

A: No, once a Warborn earn his citizenship, they may access the whole of Estra. In fact, they have 2 exclusive classes to play!

Marketplace
Q: Is there an in-game marketplace where players can directly buy the tokens/currency, or do they have to purchase from an external exchange?
A: Both. We have an in-game Marketplace that can offer NFT and token trades directly or you may find Evrloot NFTs on external marketplaces as well.

Community Membership

A: It's not a must, but we love seeing you around on Discord! Leaderboard and event rewards are minted to wallets automatically.

Supported Platforms?
Q: What device can I play on, mobile/PC/console?

First steps
Q: What are some examples of the initial tasks new players should focus on when starting out?
A: Initially, players will be presented with two paths: Collecting resources (RSS) and/or fighting in Expeditions in hopes of claiming some loot! You can start by collecting water. Water is key!

Controls
Q: How complex are the game controls?
A: Game controls are simple: point with the mouse and click to move. In the world map, you can use:
$m$ for market
$l$ for inventory
$c$ for character sheet
$n$ for news

The inventory system is drag and drop, and the UI supports multiple items being moved at one time (stacks).

Leaderboards
Q: How can I show off my skills?
A: Every 'World Boss' that players engage has its own Leaderboard and associated global quests. Your efforts are recorded forever, and more importantly, are well rewarded.
