EasyPay: What is it?

Simple on-Ramp
Using EasyPay is effortless! You need credits in order to start using it. You can purchase some via 2 options:

By Credit Card
EasyPay support and has integrated a credit card on-ramp via the services of Stripe.
After clicking on "Add", select the Stripe option.
Input your credit card details and the amount wished.
And that's it! You will receive your credits instantly to be used in EasyPay.
Using Crypto
Of course, we are a Web 3.0 game; so we support crypto as well.
As of now, Evrloot supports only $GLMR (Moonbeam Blockchain) but we plan on adding many more native blockchains to offer more options to the players.
After clicking on "Add", select the GLMR/Moonbeam option.
Enter the amount of credit wished and sign the transaction. You will receive your credits instantly to be used in EasyPay.

Et voil√†! Now that you have credits, just go play the game, we will use your credits to handle any transactions, isn't that cool?

You can check what 1 EasyPay is doing by checking the transaction logs in the same window.

Modular NFTs 2.0
At the core of our game are our Citizen NFTs, designed with cutting-edge tech and rich metadata to elevate your gameplay experience. 
Powered by the RMRK technology and a suite of advanced ERC standards, our Citizen NFTs go beyond traditional NFTs. Not only can they do everything a standard NFT can, but they also have the unique ability to equip other NFTs.
This means Citizen NFTs can carry Gear NFTs alongside detailed metadata, including origin, skin tone, class, skills, professions, and much more.
With over 1 million possible trait combinations, every character is truly one of a kind!

ERC-6220
Composable NFTs with Equipopables

Now you can create NFTs with fixed and equippable parts, customizing your NFT dynamically.

Designed to work side by side with ERC-5773 and ERC6059, NFTs aren't limited to just "static JPEGs" anymore.

Here are some ways it can be used:
Customizable Avatars
Character with Experience NFT
Editable Music

Our Smart Contract Setup
Our game is powered by Smart Contracts, programs deployed on the blockchain that drive the game's logic.

What sets us apart is our sophisticated architecture. By leveraging the ERC-2535 Diamond Pattern, we gather all contract data in one place, allowing different facets to seamlessly access it.
This approach makes our setup highly adaptable-when we develop new features or game mechanics, we can easily attach a new facet with updated logic, ensuring smooth and continuous updates.

Gas Efficiency
While because of our incredible potential, poorly optimized code can lead to inefficiencies and higher transaction costs. These costs impact both us as a game studio and you as a player when interacting with the game.

To keep transaction costs in Evrloot as low as possible, we've meticulously optimized our smart contracts. One key innovation is our NFT staking mechanism, which lets you retain full ownership through a receipt while significantly reducing the need for costly transactions.
This ensures a smoother, more cost-efficient gaming experience.
